Eagle Plains had a cold, gray, windy morning on August 6th. I thought the grayness was kind of beautiful, but Manpreet (apparently solar powered) was a bit blue. After a quick breakfast, we drove back to the Arctic Circle and just sat there in Bellinda (the suburban) and identified our larvae from the previous day. (No hailstorm this time.) We had been super excited as the larvae were definitely Somatochlora, but now as we looked at them—Manpreet carefully drying their butts with toilet paper to get a better look at their hind appendages—we discovered that they were most likely S. albicincta (Ringed Emerald). The features that differentiate these two species are very subtle and it was hard to tell, but alas, they didn’t seem to be the S. sahlbergi that we were looking for.

We spent the rest of the day driving toward Fort McPherson (the southern-most of the 2 towns along the Dempster). Gray clouds hung low over everything and as we approached the border between the Yukon and Northwest Territories (km 468), the temperature began to fall. At the border, grass and shrubs were covered in a thick layer of ice and it was -1° C! The first 40 or so km east of the border were the most beautiful. Sweeping green landscape, rolling hills and a few taller mountains. Because the clouds were hanging low over everything, we imagined the mountains to be much taller than we later discovered and we dubbed them the Misty Mountains. Eventually the road got really muddy along a long stretch just west of the Peel River ferry crossing. At the crossing itself, the road was also muddy and just kind of ended as we boarded the ferry and started up again on the other side. The ferryman was a friendly First Nations man who told us how the unseasonably cool and rainy weather was affecting his caribou and whale hunting this season. Fascinating!
